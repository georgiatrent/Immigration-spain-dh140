    "# Immigration into Spain: A Case Study\n",
    "*This is the main notebook for this project. All code, analysis and discussion is contained within this document.*\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction \n",
    "This summer, I was an intern at a small non-profit organization based out of Barcelona called the **Open Cultural Center (OCC)**. Its main goal is to support migrants and refugees coming into Spain through free language classes, career workshops, and skill-based classes, as long as need is demonstrated. I took a particular interest in **Migracode**, a daughter project specializing in coding skills classes. Given my background as a female computer science major, I was curious about the general demographics of these classes, and whether this sample reflects those of Barcelona's immigrant population as a whole. I also wondered if any origin countries were increasingly represented among Migracode students. \n",
    "\n",
    "These are important questions to ask, as [the educational level of the immigrant population in Spain has remained stagnant since the beginning of the century](https://blog.funcas.es/el-nivel-educativo-de-la-poblacion-inmigrante-en-espana-permanece-estancado-desde-principios-de-siglo/) *despite* positive population growth solely due to immigration. Certain South American countries are eligible for [expedited Spanish nationality applications](https://corralinternational.com/en/complete-guide-for-latin-american-citizens-emigrating-to-spain/#:~:text=Requirements:%20After%20residing%20legally%20in%20Spain%20for,only%20requires%20two%20years%20of%20legal%20residency.), and arrivals continue to break records each year. For these reasons and many others, the OCC needs to be able to recognize whether it effectively attracts immigrants in need so that it can continue to receive donor support. More importantly, it needs to make sure that no eligible immigrant feels deterred from applying on the basis of exclusion or cultural expectations. \n",
    "\n",
    "Luckily, it was easy to obtain the data for all of the students who have taken classes through **Migracode** from the years 2021 (its origin year) through 2024. \n",
    "\n",
    "Next, I took a look at the **Migracode** user-facing website and walked through the application process myself. There are four requirements in order to apply.\n",
    "*Here is the link if you would like to look at the website:*\n",
    " \n",
    "#### Requirements to be a Migracode Student:\n",
    "\n",
    "**(1)** EITHER / Be a refugee or asylum seeker / Be a migrant from outside the EU who cannot find work / OR / Be a migrant from outside the EU in a difficult/vulnerable living situation\n",
    "\n",
    "**(2)** Be fluent in **English** or **Spanish**\n",
    "\n",
    "**(3)** Have **documentation** to live/work in Spain \n",
    "\n",
    "**(4)** Live in/around **Barcelona**\n",
    "\n",
    "<u>Henceforth, I will be refering to people fulfilling these four criteria as **4 Criteria People**. I will refer to people who are or have been Migracode students as **Migracode Students**.</u>\n",
    "\n",
    "The form on the Migracode website populates an entry in the data table once a new student has applied. The data table I will start with has been populated with a new row each time a new student applies.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Research Question: How do Migracode Students differ from 4 Criteria People? \n",
    "\n",
    "I want to know if **Migracode Students** represent the general population of **4 Criteria People**, or if there are certain groups that are more highly saturated among **Migracode Students**. \n",
    "\n",
    "This may help to determine which groups respond to Migracode recruitment, in order to better target groups which are underrepresented. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Some sub-questions: \n",
    "### Do Migracode Students already have technical experience? \n",
    "\n",
    "This question aims to address the approachability of Migracode classes. The courses are intended to be easy to apply for and encouraging of little to no technical background (unless they are taking the advanced courses). \n",
    "\n",
    "If most **Migracode Students** indicate that they already have experience, there may be other factors that discourage unexperienced people to apply, like marketing or website interface. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Where do Migracode students come from? \n",
    "\n",
    "Are certain countries of origin represented more highly among **Migracode Students** than **4 Criteria People**?  \n",
    "\n",
    "### What portion of students are over the age of 30? \n",
    "\n",
    "It's possible that filling out an online application or embarking on a course in technical skills is more approachable for a younger generation. "

    "## Methods / The Data\n",
    "I will be using the following datasets/doxuments, described in more detail below:\n",
    "\n",
    "**(1)** Migracode's Students Database (modified for anonymity, cleanliness, and application)\n",
    "\n",
    "**(2)** Ajuntament de Barcelona's (City Hall of Barcelona) public Immigrants by Nationality, Sex, and Age dataset, 2023\n",
    "\n",
    "**(3)** Spain Profiling of new arrivals (January - December 2023) \n",
    "\n",
    "### Limitations\n",
    "My main research question is a lofty and largely unattainable ask for the following reasons: \n",
    "\n",
    "**There is no way to find data on broader 4 Criteria People.** That is, people who are  (1) immigrants/aslum seekers in sub-optimal financial/employment situations (2) speaking english or spanish,  (3) with documentation (4) in Barcelona. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Why?**\n",
    "- There is *yearly population data* on immigration into Barcelona, but it doesn't get into income, employment or spoken language. Neighborhoods are described, which can hint at financial situation, but ultimately are unreliable indicators. \n",
    "- There is *asylum seeker annual arrival data*, but it doesn't describe individual cities or work documentation.\n",
    "- Annual reports don't describe immigrants who may have arrived a long time ago.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Solutions\n",
    "\n",
    "I will describe Migracode students as they appear in the applications data table. Then, I will use various sources for information about arrivals or immigrants in Spain to hopefully describe its immigrant population, though it will be impossible to describe the very specific **4 Criteria Person** demographic. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Migracode's Students Database\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Cleaning\n",
    "Migracode's data table was originally populated through the use of a form, intended to register students for individual classes. This means that if a returning student filled out the form for a new class, they were added to the table as a new entry. In order to process each entry as **one individual**, I needed to find a way to combine entries.\n",
    "\n",
    "I alphabetized the entries by name so that it was more clear which people had taken multiple classes over time, and then manually extraneous entries by the same person. I replaced a field originally called **Course** with a field called **Most Basic Course Taken** which describes whether the person *ever* took a basic level course. \n",
    "\n",
    "To preserve anonymity, after each person only had one entry, I removed the names from the sheet and replaced them with an index. This process reduced the entries from 1731 to 1390. \n",
    "\n",
    "I also added Did not report or Unknown values, as sometimes there are empty values, which can get in the way of code execution. \n",

    "During the internship, while I was often tasked with web development issues, my coworker was instructed to improve many of the data tables, as there are many across OCC's various other projects. He ran into issues when attempting to automate what I have manually done here, as people can misspell their names, use the same email for different people, or use many different formats for phone numbers. OCC doesn't currently use a unique identifier such as a student ID. Because it's such a small organization, we quickly realized that we were the only people trying to improve this (me by looking over his shoulder). This makes it difficult for the people at OCC to draw conclusions about their students, and for me to do the same throughout this project.  \n",
