## About 
Barcelona, Spain is an increasingly global and diverse city. The rate of entry of international residents continues to rise, attracted by the relatively low cost of living, climate and quality of life. It also attracts those seeking asylum. 

The Open Cultural Center is an NGO aimed at assisting immigrants coming into Spain and other parts of Europe, offering language classes and career development courses. Migracode, one of their projects, specifically offers classes in coding and technical skills, and operates exclusively in Barcelona. 

This case study observes the students of Migracode, from the years 2021 to 2024, and compares them to the general population of immigrants or refugees in Barcelona. 

### Research Questions

Do Migracodee students reflect the demographics of the general immigrant population in Barcelona? 

Are Migracode students more likely to be a certain gender or come from a certain origin country? 

What type of classes are the most popular?
